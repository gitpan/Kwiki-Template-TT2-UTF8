This module provide a Template::Providor hack to deal with UTF8
characters in templates. With the base class any nonâASCII characters
wouldd be encoded to utf8 as latinâ1, which means Kanji characters
will be split into byes, and displaied corruptly.

This module is not a Kwiki plugin, therefore it’s useless to edit the
"plugins" file.

See the perldoc of Kwiki::Template::TT2::UTF8 for how to enable
this module.
